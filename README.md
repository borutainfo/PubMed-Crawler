# PubMed Crawler 1.0

###1. About

It is a simple crawler for PubMed database. The application allows you to retrieve selected data from PubMed, and then search your collection using the Lucene index.

###2. Importing the project

The project should be imported into NetBeans IDE (I used version 8.1). You need to add additional libraries, which does not contain the repository:

- sqlite-jdbc-3.8.11.2.jar

- lucene-core-6.0.1.jar

- lucene-queryparser-6.0.1.jar

- lucene-analyzers-common-6.0.1.jar

You can of course try to use a different version of libraries.

###3. Additional information

If you are not a programmer, you can download executable files. Your system must have Java installed. More information can be found in the guide (written in Polish). 

###4. Author and license

The application was created by [Sebastian Boruta](http://boruta.info/) from Poland, and is distributed under the MIT license.
